I am simply writing just to fill the space so that I can see the effects of text-justify property and I think this way will definitely work. Today, I got a message from EduTech for an internship offer whose stipend was very low but it's also important to have atleast an internship, because having no internship will be more disappointing and I will not be able to see anyway to earn money and I could lose my confidence. But what if, I am not able to clear this interview too, that will be most disappointing and if not, then it should be."
